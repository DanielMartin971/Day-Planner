# Day-Planner || HTML & CSS & JS

## Description

This is the 5th project in our bootcamp! Here we had to make a day planner for a busy worker that changed colors depending on the time of day and also saved whatever they planned into our localstorage so it would still load on the page later on in the day even if the window was closed. The javascript required us to add a class of either late, present, or future and would then get its colors by that!

## Installation

I had to clone the code from the starter code we recieved. In it had some HTML elements, some links to bootstrap, jquery and had a CSS file used already. We had to do all the work in the js file mainly and some in the HTML

## Usage

This would be used for a daily planner if need be. Indicating whether or not a task is already late or you still have some time to burn!
